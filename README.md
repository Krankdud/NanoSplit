# NanoSplit

NanoSplit is a web based speedrun timer built using TypeScript and React. This timer is designed to be used on mobile. If you are using a desktop, I recommend using [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/) instead.

## Todo

- [ ] Import splits from LiveSplit files
- [ ] Export splits to LiveSplit format
- [ ] Add colors to splits for behind, ahead, etc
- [x] Add tip to press anywhere to start or split
- [ ] Countdown before starting timer
